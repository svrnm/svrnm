### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Severin, Head of Community & Developer Relations at [Causely](https://www.causely.ai/), a co-maintainer of the OpenTelemetry SIG Communications ([Website and Docs](github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry.io)) and the author of [DemoMonkey](https://github.com/svrnm/demomonkey), a browser extension that helps to tailor custom demos.

If you are interested in helping out with the OpenTelemetry SIG Communications, take a look at the issues labeled [`help wanted`](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry.io/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22+).

DemoMonkey needs help! Since switching from Manifest V2 to Manifest V3, DemoMonkey is experiencing an ongoing issue. If you know some JavaScript and how to build browser extension, [leave a comment on this issue](https://github.com/svrnm/DemoMonkey/issues/131).

Many years ago I wrote my master thesis about parallel GrÃ¶bner basis computations. You can find the source code at [svrnm/parallelGBC](https://github.com/svrnm/parallelGBC).
